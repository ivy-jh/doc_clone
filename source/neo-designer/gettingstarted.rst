Getting Started
---------------

.. rubric:: Create a Workspace

To start working with NEO Designer you first create a workspace.
A workspace is the development area where an application is built and tested. 
It's the space where your business processes are designed, previewed and 
simulated before they're deployed as a functioning application.
In a newly created workspace, you will find a first main project as your starting 
point to begin your work.

.. rubric:: Draw a Process model

A process describes a sequence of automated steps that optimize workflows and 
enables efficient task management within an application.
Start the |ivy| :ref:`process-editor` that is included in NEO Designer to design 
and edit a process model.

.. rubric:: Define the Data

A data class is used to define and structure the data within a process application. 
It is used to manage data consistently across processes and forms.
Use the |ivy| :ref:`data-class-editor` that is part of NEO to define the list of data 
attributes used in the process.

.. rubric:: Create Forms

A form is a user interface element that facilitates data entry and interaction with 
the application, acting as a bridge between users and the system.
The |ivy| :ref:`form-editor` is a graphical modeling tool to design dynamic forms.

.. rubric:: Simulate the application

Included in NEO Designer is a simulator feature to execute and test a process 
with a sinlge click.

.. rubric:: Add Configurations 

Configurations are the settings and parameters that define how an application behaves 
and interacts with other systems.
Use the :ref:`variables-editor` to create, delete, and edit the key and values of Variables.

.. rubric:: Import more Projects

Projects can be imported into the workspace either from the :ref:`market` or from a file.
In the |ivy| market you can find and download reusable components, templates and 
solutions to accelerate development.
In collaboration with a pro designer packed project files will be shared.

To use the components from imported projects they must be added as a dependency to 
the main project.
