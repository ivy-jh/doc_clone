Multi-Tenancy
*************

As your business grows, you are looking for an effective way to provide your
application to multiple customers. You need to ensure that these customers will
not notice each other or even see confidential information. This chapter
explains and compares how to set up multiple tenants.

Multi-tenant means making the same software available to several customers. You
can do that either by solving this problem with infrastructure and using
:ref:`multiple engines <multi-tenancy-engines>` which is highly recommended
or do that all on the :ref:`same engine <multi-tenancy-security-systems>`.
