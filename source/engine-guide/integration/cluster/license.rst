Enterprise License
==================

You need an enterprise license to run Axon Ivy Engine as a Cluster (Axon Ivy Engine
Enterprise Edition). 

The information needed to request an enterprise license is the same as for a
Standard Edition :ref:`license`, with the exception of the number of cluster
nodes.

Cluster Nodes
-------------

Each node that you add to an Axon Ivy Engine Cluster costs an additional license fee.
Therefore, the number of nodes in your Cluster is limited by the license.

.. warning:: 
  If you add more nodes to your Cluster than your license has been issued for, 
  then the nodes that are not licensed correctly will respond with
  error code :code:`503 Service Unavailable`.
