OpenSearch
==========

|ivy-engine| is using OpenSearch for providing full-text searches and
statistics. OpenSearch itself is :ref:`bundled <opensearch-bundled>` with
|ivy-engine|. For systems with high load or using |ivy| :ref:`cluster`, you may
need to run an :ref:`external <opensearch-external>` OpenSearch instance.
