Permissions
-----------

Permissions define who can do what. They can be assigned to users and roles.
Only assign permissions that are really required to roles and users. We strongly
recommend to not assign the permission :code:`GRANT ALL` to the role
:code:`EVERYBODY` and always prefer role-based permissions over user-based
permissions.

You can assign permissions to roles and users in the :ref:`Engine Cockpit
<engine-cockpit-security-system>`.
