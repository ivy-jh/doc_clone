Try |ivy|!
***************

The |ivy-designer| is free of charge. You can start developing your projects
right away.


We offer you two ways to try the |ivy-engine|:

**Demo Mode**
The |ivy-engine| runs out of the box with a demo license and an in-memory
database. As long as you don't restart the engine, you can do everything you can
do with a licensed, production-ready engine.

To try the |ivy-engine| this way, follow the Engine Guide Chapter :ref:`Getting
Started <getting-started>` but skip the license installation.

**Cloud Trial**
If you want to try an |ivy-engine| with a persisting database, you can get a
trial engine in the cloud via https://www.axonivy.com/try-it-now. It comes
complete with a two-week fully functional license and full web access to the engine. 

With this option, you don't need to install an engine - use a local
|ivy-designer| to develop your trial project and deploy it to the |ivy-engine| in the
cloud.
