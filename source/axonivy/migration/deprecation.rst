Deprecation and Removal
-----------------------

You should avoid using deprecated Public APIs and features. When migrating to a
new version, check for deprecated Public APIs and features and replace them with
the successor API or feature. 

This will help you later when you migrate to a version in which the previously
Public APIs or features are no longer available.
