Migration
=========

The migration process from one |ivy-engine| version to another differs 
highly among the supported operating systems and the kind of migration.

**Hotfix Upgrade**

If you are looking for the update steps to keep your |ivy-engine| on the
latest patch level (e.g., ``8.0.6`` > ``8.0.13``), 
please consult the :ref:`migration-upgrade-engine-hotfix` chapter.

**Major / Minor Upgrade**

When you aim for a migration to another major version (e.g., ``8.0.30`` > ``10.0.20``)
or minor version (e.g., ``11.1`` > ``11.2``) please consult the :ref:`migration-upgrade-engine-major`
chapter.

**Migration Tools**

To ease the migration we provide :ref:`migration-tools`.
