What is |ivy|?
====================

|ivy| is a Process Automation Platform that simplifies and automates the
interaction of humans with their digital systems. The platform is typically
responsible for the most precious business cases where companies produce value.
Here is how we do it:

**Visualize**
    Our platform allows you to **document business processes fast and
    intuitive**. A shared view of users, roles, departments and technical
    systems involved in a business process improves your work. HR recruitment
    profiles become clearer, bottlenecks become obvious, ideas for effective
    improvements arise from anyone involved in the process.

**Automate**
    Documented processes are good. But what you really want is to **drive your
    highly valuable processes automatically**. Employees are often interrupted
    by searching and filtering data from various tools and feeding this data
    into other technical systems. Even though value is produced in a well-known
    business case, there is a lack of a straightforward interface that guides
    the involved users through the process. Valuable data is often segregated
    and stored in various dedicated technical systems. With |ivy|, you can drive
    your process automatically. Our platform can easily orchestrate people, data
    and technical systems. You can generate an initial application that leads
    users through the process without hiring a software engineer. People can
    contribute to the process by using their favorite devices such as
    smartphones or workstations.

**Improve**
    The digitalization of your company can **evolve over time**. We favor small
    predictable improvements over big-bang solutions. The |ivy| Platform allows
    you to start quickly and simply with your existing environment. You may
    start with just task notifications sent to users that should contribute to a
    running process. And eventually, the platform becomes your single interface
    for all your business interactions. You will be able to measure KPIs based
    on the data that is produced during the execution of your business
    processes. Based on these insights, you can advance your business constantly
    and effectively. The cost of business transformations become reasonable and
    predictable.

The |ivy| Platform consists of the :ref:`|ivy-designer| <designer-guide>` which
enables the drawing, simulation and implementation of automated business
processes, and the application server :ref:`|ivy-engine| <engine-guide>` that
executes your business cases and provides a shared interface for process users.
