User Dialogs
============

A User Dialog is one of the two possibilities to interact with the user
in a process. The other is a simple :ref:`user-interface-web-page`.
User Dialogs are based on Java Server Faces (JSF) technology.

In Axon Ivy, we use :ref:`html-dialogs` - or HD for short
- as the name for a User Dialog Component built with JSF.
