User Interface
**************

There are different ways to implement your dialog pages. 

If you have standard workflow forms etc. use :ref:`user-dialogs`. 

If you only have an application-based view, which doesn't need process or task
data you want to use JSF in a :ref:`static page <static-jsf-pages>`. You can use
these pages as an end page in a workflow, too.

You can also use plain HTML or JSP :ref:`user-interface-web-page` to display an
end page.
