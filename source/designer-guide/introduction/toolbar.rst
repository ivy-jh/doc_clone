Toolbar
=======

The main window of Axon Ivy shows a toolbar with various buttons which
is situated right below the menu bar of the application. This section
explains the most important actions for Axon Ivy users that can be found
on the toolbar.

.. Note::

   The number and activity state of the buttons that are shown in the
   toolbar depend on the current selection and the currently active
   editor. They may therefore slightly vary and not exactly correspond
   to the screenshot below.

New Wizard Selector

   This button opens a drop down list with all available *new wizards*
   to create new resources for editing. Some of the shown wizards are
   contributed by the Eclipse system and are not Axon Ivy specific.

   To create new Axon Ivy resources it is recommended to use the menu
   entry :guilabel:`Axon Ivy` > :guilabel:`New...` or to use the
   context menu in the Axon Ivy project tree.
