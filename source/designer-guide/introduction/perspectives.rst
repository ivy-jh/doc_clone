Perspectives
============

A perspective defines a set and layout of views and editors in the
workbench window. The current perspective is displayed on the title bar
of the window and it is highlighted at the upper right corner in the
shortcut bar. You can open and switch to a specific perspective using
the Window menu or the buttons in the shortcut bar in the upper right
corner.

You can change the perspectives as you like. Editors and views can be
rearranged in a perspective by just moving them around. It's also
possible to close views or display additional ones
(via :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Show View`).
Furthermore there is a functionality to reset a perspective to
its default settings (via :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Reset Perspective`).
