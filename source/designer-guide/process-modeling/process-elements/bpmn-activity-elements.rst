BPMN Activity Elements
======================

The *BPMN Activity* drawer contains elements, that can be used to design
a process at a high level, where details of the technical implementation
are hidden inside the element itself. Thus BPMN Activities behave
similar to a :ref:`process-element-embedded-sub`, but their purpose is different.
