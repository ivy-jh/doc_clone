Embedded Subprocess
===================

|image0| The *Subprocess* element is located in the *Activity* drawer of
the process editor palette.

Element Details
---------------

An embedded subprocess folds a part of a process into a box. This makes
hierarchical structuring of the process model possible. Subprocesses
are obtained top down or bottom up. Either by selecting and wrap parts
of a process or by inserting an (initially empty) embedded sub element
from the palette.
