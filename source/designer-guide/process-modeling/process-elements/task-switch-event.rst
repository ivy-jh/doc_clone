Task Switch Event
=================

|image0| The *Task Switch Event* element is located in the *Event & Gateway*
drawer of the process editor palette.

Element Details
---------------

The Task Switch Event element has the same function as the :ref:`process-element-task-switch-gateway`
element. The difference
is, that a Task Switch Event element can only have one input and one
output, instead of multiple ones like the parallel Task Switch Gateway.
The usage of this simplified element is to have a more BPMN conform
element.

See :ref:`process-element-task-switch-gateway` for a
more detailed description.
