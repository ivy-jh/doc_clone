Process Editor
--------------

The Process editor is used to design and edit the different process kinds
(mostly *business* and *User Dialog logic* processes). The Process editor
has different parts:

-  the :ref:`process-editor-area`, where the process logic is constructed element
   for element

-  the :ref:`process-editor-tool-bar`, where some tools are located and also all
   elements, which can be added to the process

-  the :ref:`process-editor-viewport-tool-bar`, where some tools for the
   viewport are located

-  the :ref:`process-editor-quick-actions`, where you find quick actions according to the current selection

Editor Area
~~~~~~~~~~~

Processes are designed, drawn and modified in the process editor area.
Select an element from the palette, then click in the process editor
area to place it. Click and drag elements to move them.

Connectors are drawn between two elements by using the **Connector Tool** in the
:ref:`process-editor-tool-bar` or clicking on the first element and select the
**Connector Tool** over the :ref:`process-editor-quick-actions`. You can also
add more bend waypoints to a connector or move them, by select the connector
and drag the handles. To reconnect a existing connector select the connector and
move the target handle to another element.

On each element you have a :ref:`process-editor-quick-actions`, which provides
useful actions to edit the element. If you select multiple elements, you have
access to the :ref:`process-editor-quick-actions-multi`. And also on
:ref:`connectors <process-editor-quick-actions-connector>` and :ref:`swimlanes
<process-editor-quick-actions-lanes>` you will get a Quick Action Menu.

To scroll in the process editor simply drag the diagram. If you want to Zoom,
use your mouse wheel. To undo/redo or copy/paste you can use the **Edit** menu
of the IDE or use the default shortcuts (`Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + V`,
etc.).
