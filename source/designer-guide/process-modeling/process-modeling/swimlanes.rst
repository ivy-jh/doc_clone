Swimlanes
---------

.. figure:: /_images/process-editor/swimlanes.png

Processes can be visually structured by using *pools* and *lanes*. Pools and
lanes are swimlanes with a label that is placed *behind* the process logic.
Swimlanes have a *horizontal* orientation and can have a colored border.

Swimlanes are available for all process kinds and are typically used to
visualize organizations, roles, responsibility assignments or systems
for process elements or sections of process logic.

If you select a pool or lane, you can widened or narrowed it by dragging the
handle below or move it by dragging the top handle. The position of process
elements lying outside the modified lane are not adjusted accordingly.

You will also get access to the **Lane Quick Action Menu** if you select a
pool/lane, where you can do the following actions:

Delete:
   Delete the selected lane/pool.

Edit Label:
   Edit the label of the selected lane/pool.

Create Lane:
   *Only available on pools*

   Create a new embedded lane inside the selected pool.

.. note::

   Please note, that pools and lanes do not have any *syntactical*
   meaning whatsoever; their purpose is purely semantical. A pool or
   lane is *not* a container that elements are placed in or associated
   with. They are simply a structured "coloring" of the process'
   background; they do not grow or shrink when you change the processes
   logic and need to be adjusted manually.
