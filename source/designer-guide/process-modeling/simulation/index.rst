Simulating process models
=========================

This chapter deals with Axon Ivy debugging and simulation features.
Processes, workflows, User Dialogs and changes on these should be tested
before being deployed on an Axon Ivy production Engine. Therefore the
Designer allows to simulate processes on your local computer, to debug
it in depth and to inspect the execution history of all variable values.
Hereby the process flow can be animated to visually observe the actual
process execution sequence.
